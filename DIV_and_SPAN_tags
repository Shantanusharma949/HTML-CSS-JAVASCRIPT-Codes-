#THEORY
#DIV is a Block-Level element, which means it is printed in a new line alone.No other element is printed with div, every div needs new line to get printed.
#SPAN is an Inline-Level element, which means it is printed in the same line. No new line is used by the span element to get printed.
#Block-Level elements can contains Inline elements but vice-versa is not possoble.
#It implies that DIV can contains SPAN but SPAN can not contani DIV elements.
